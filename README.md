# NTOU Code-Review Assignment

This repo used for a classroom assignment in the "Desktop Application Development" (B53025QU) course at NTOU.    
The example_for_CodeReview.cpp program reads student names and a fixed number of scores, then computes and prints each student's average score.    
The purpose of this repository is to practice code review and collaboration using GitHub.

This README only provides a brief description of the assignment.
